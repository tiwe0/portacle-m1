/* This feature has already saved me more development time than it
 * took to implement.  In its current state, ``dynamic RT<->core
 * linking'' is a protocol of initialization of C runtime and Lisp
 * core, populating SBCL linkage table with entries for runtime
 * "foreign" symbols that were referenced in cross-compiled code.
 *
 * How it works: a sketch
 *
 * Last Genesis (resulting in cold-sbcl.core) binds foreign fixups in
 * x-compiled lisp-objs to sequential addresses from the beginning of
 * linkage-table space; that's how it ``resolves'' foreign references.
 * Obviously, this process doesn't require pre-built runtime presence.
 *
 * When the runtime loads the core (cold-sbcl.core initially,
 * sbcl.core later), runtime should do its part of the protocol by (1)
 * traversing a list of ``runtime symbols'' prepared by Genesis and
 * dumped as a static symbol value, (2) resolving each name from this
 * list to an address (stubbing unresolved ones with
 * undefined_alien_address or undefined_alien_function), (3) adding an
 * entry for each symbol somewhere near the beginning of linkage table
 * space (location is provided by the core).
 *
 * The implementation of the part described in the last paragraph
 * follows. C side is currently more ``hackish'' and less clear than
 * the Lisp code; OTOH, related Lisp changes are scattered, and some
 * of them play part in complex interrelations -- beautiful but taking
 * much time to understand --- but my subset of PE-i386 parser below
 * is in one place (here) and doesn't have _any_ non-trivial coupling
 * with the rest of the Runtime.
 *
 * What do we gain with this feature, after all?
 *
 * One things that I have to do rather frequently: recompile and
 * replace runtime without rebuilding the core. Doubtlessly, slam.sh
 * was a great time-saver here, but relinking ``cold'' core and bake a
 * ``warm'' one takes, as it seems, more than 10x times of bare
 * SBCL.EXE build time -- even if everything is recompiled, which is
 * now unnecessary. Today, if I have a new idea for the runtime,
 * getting from C-x C-s M-x ``compile'' to fully loaded SBCL
 * installation takes 5-15 seconds.
 *
 * Another thing (that I'm not currently using, but obviously
 * possible) is delivering software patches to remote system on
 * customer site. As you are doing minor additions or corrections in
 * Lisp code, it doesn't take much effort to prepare a tiny ``FASL
 * bundle'' that rolls up your patch, redumps and -- presto -- 100MiB
 * program is fixed by sending and loading a 50KiB thingie.
 *
 * However, until LISP_FEATURE_ALIEN_LINKAGE_TABLE, if your bug were fixed
 * by modifying two lines of _C_ sources, a customer described above
 * had to be ready to receive and reinstall a new 100MiB
 * executable. With the aid of code below, deploying such a fix
 * requires only sending ~300KiB (when stripped) of SBCL.EXE.
 *
 * But there is more to it: as the common linkage-table is used for
 * DLLs and core, its entries may be overridden almost without a look
 * into SBCL internals. Therefore, ``patching'' C runtime _without_
 * restarting target systems is also possible in many situations
 * (it's not as trivial as loading FASLs into a running daemon, but
 * easy enough to be a viable alternative if any downtime is highly
 * undesirable).
 *
 * During my (rather limited) commercial Lisp development experience
 * I've already been through a couple of situations where such
 * ``deployment'' issues were important; from my _total_ programming
 * experience I know -- _sometimes_ they are a two orders of magnitude
 * more important than those I observed.
 *
 * The possibility of entire runtime ``hot-swapping'' in running
 * process is not purely theoretical, as it could seem. There are 2-3
 * problems whose solution is not obvious (call stack patching, for
 * instance), but it's literally _nothing_ if compared with
 * e.g. LISP_FEATURE_SB_AUTO_FPU_SWITCH.  By the way, one of the
 * problems with ``hot-swapping'', that could become a major one in
 * many other environments, is nonexistent in SBCL: we already have a
 * ``global quiesce point'' that is generally required for this kind
 * of worldwide revolution -- around collect_garbage.
 *
 * If we look at the majority of the ``new style'' code units, it's a
 * common thing to observe how #+-ifdeffery _vanishes_ instead of
 * multiplying: #-sb-xc, #+sb-xc-host and #-sb-xc-host end up
 * needing the same code. Runtime checks of static v. dynamic symbol
 * disappear even faster. STDCALL mangling and leading underscores go
 * out of scope (and GCed, hopefully) instead of surfacing here and
 * there as a ``special case for core static symbols''. What I like
 * the most about CL development in general is a frequency of solving
 * problems and fixing bugs by simplifying code and dropping special
 * cases.
 *
 * Last important thing about the following code: besides resolving
 * symbols provided by the core itself, it detects runtime's own
 * build-time prerequisite DLLs. Any symbol that is unresolved against
 * the core is looked up in those DLLs (normally kernel32, msvcrt,
 * ws2_32... I could forget something). This action (1) resembles
 * implementation of foreign symbol lookup in SBCL itself, (2)
 * emulates shared library d.l. facilities of OSes that use flat
 * dynamic symbol namespace (or default to it). Anyone concerned with
 * portability problems of this PE-i386 stuff below will be glad to
 * hear that it could be ported to most modern Unices _by deletion_:
 * raw dlsym() with null handle usually does the same thing that i'm
 * trying to squeeze out of MS Windows by the brute force.
 *
 * My reason for _desiring_ flat symbol namespace, populated from
 * link-time dependencies, is avoiding any kind of ``requested-by-Lisp
 * symbol lists to be linked statically'', providing core v. runtime
 * independence in both directions. Minimizing future maintenance
 * effort is very important; I had gone for it consistently, starting
 * by turning "CloseHandle@4" into a simple "CloseHandle", continuing
 * by adding intermediate Genesis resulting in autogenerated symbol
 * list (farewell, void scratch(); good riddance), going to take
 * another great step for core/runtime independence... and _without_
 * flat namespace emulation, the ghosts and spirits exiled at the
 * first steps would come and take revenge: well, here are the symbols
 * that are really in msvcrt.dll.. hmm, let's link statically against
 * them, so the entry is pulled from the import library.. and those
 * entry has mangled names that we have to map.. ENOUGH, I though
 * here: fed up with stuff like that.
 *
 * Now here we are, without import libraries, without mangled symbols,
 * and without nm-generated symbol tables. Every symbol exported by
 * the runtime is added to SBCL.EXE export directory; every symbol
 * requested by the core is looked up by GetProcAddress for SBCL.EXE,
 * falling back to GetProcAddress for MSVCRT.dll, etc etc.. All ties
 * between SBCL's foreign symbols with object file symbol tables,
 * import libraries and other pre-linking symbol-resolving entities
 * _having no representation in SBCL.EXE_ were teared.
 *
 * This simplistic approach proved to work well; there is only one
 * problem introduced by it, and rather minor: in real MSVCRT.dll,
 * what's used to be available as open() is now called _open();
 * similar thing happened to many other `lowio' functions, though not
 * every one, so it's not a kind of name mangling but rather someone's
 * evil creative mind in action.
 *
 * When we look up any of those poor `uglified' functions in CRT
 * reference on MSDN, we can see a notice resembling this one:
 *
 * `unixishname()' is obsolete and provided for backward
 * compatibility; new standard-compliant function, `_unixishname()',
 * should be used instead.  Sentences of that kind were there for
 * several years, probably even for a decade or more (a propos,
 * MSVCRT.dll, as the name to link against, predates year 2000, so
 * it's actually possible). Reasoning behing it (what MS people had in
 * mind) always seemed strange to me: if everyone uses open() and that
 * `everyone' is important to you, why rename the function?  If no one
 * uses open(), why provide or retain _open() at all? <kidding>After
 * all, names like _open() are entirely non-informative and just plain
 * ugly; compare that with CreateFileW() or InitCommonControlsEx(),
 * the real examples of beauty and clarity.</kidding>
 *
 * Anyway, if the /standard/ name on Windows is _open() (I start to
 * recall, vaguely, that it's because of _underscore names being
 * `reserved to system' and all other ones `available for user', per
 * ANSI/ISO C89) -- well, if the /standard/ name is _open, SBCL should
 * use it when it uses MSVCRT and not some ``backward-compatible''
 * stuff. Deciding this way, I added a hack to SBCL's syscall macros,
 * so "[_]open" as a syscall name is interpreted as a request to link
 * agains "_open" on win32 and "open" on every other system.
 *
 * Of course, this name-parsing trick lacks conceptual clarity; we're
 * going to get rid of it eventually. */

/* We want to get a slot in TIB that (1) is available at constant
   offset, (2) is our private property, so libraries wouldn't legally
   override it, (3) contains something predefined for threads created
   out of our sight.

   Low 64 TLS slots are adressable directly, starting with
   FS:[#xE10]. When SBCL runtime is initialized, some of the low slots
   may be already in use by its prerequisite DLLs, as DllMain()s and
   TLS callbacks have been called already. But slot 63 is unlikely to
   be reached at this point: one slot per DLL that needs it is the
   common practice, and many system DLLs use predefined TIB-based
   areas outside conventional TLS storage and don't need TLS slots.
   With our current dependencies, even slot 2 is observed to be free
   (as of WinXP and wine).

   Now we'll call TlsAlloc() repeatedly until slot 63 is officially
   assigned to us, then TlsFree() all other slots for normal use. TLS
   slot 63, alias FS:[#.(+ #xE10 (* 4 63))], now belongs to us.

   To summarize, let's list the assumptions we make:

   - TIB, which is FS segment base, contains first 64 TLS slots at the
   offset #xE10 (i.e. TIB layout compatibility);
   - TLS slots are allocated from lower to higher ones;
   - All libraries together with CRT startup have not requested 64
   slots yet.

   All these assumptions together don't seem to be less warranted than
   the availability of TIB arbitrary data slot for our use. There are
   some more reasons to prefer slot 63 over TIB arbitrary data: (1) if
   our assumptions for slot 63 are violated, it will be detected at
   startup instead of causing some system-specific unreproducible
   problems afterwards, depending on OS and loaded foreign libraries;
   (2) if getting slot 63 reliably with our current approach will
   become impossible for some future Windows version, we can add TLS
   callback directory to SBCL binary; main image TLS callback is
   started before _any_ TLS slot is allocated by libraries, and
   some C compiler vendors rely on this fact. */

/*
 * x86-64 exception handling around foreign function calls.
 *
 * On x86-64, when an exception is raised, the Windows kernel looks up the RIP
 * to retrieve an associated UNWIND_INFO object. This object informs the kernel
 * whether there's an exception handler and how to find the start of the current
 * frame. If there's no exception handler or it has declined to handle the
 * exception, the frame's return address is looked up and the process is
 * repeated, walking the stack until an exception handler handles the exception.
 * If the exception goes unhandled, the process is usually terminated. Our goal,
 * then, is to associate an appropriate UNWIND_INFO object with return addresses
 * that point to Lisp code. We don't need to inform the kernel how to walk a
 * Lisp frame, since our exception handler will always handle the exception.
 *
 * UNWIND_INFO objects are mapped onto their respective address ranges by
 * RUNTIME_FUNCTION objects. These objects are usually stored in the .pdata
 * section of an executable file, but can also be mapped dynamically via
 * RtlAddFunctionTable().
 *
 * A major constraint imposed by UNWIND_INFO and RUNTIME_FUNCTION is that the
 * code's address range is specified by 32-bit relative addresses, which means
 * we can only establish a frame-based handler for a 4 GB region at most. This
 * is problematic because most Lisp code lives in dynamic space which can be
 * much larger than 4 GB. Furthermore, the exception handler is also specified
 * as a 32-bit relative address, so we can't directly reference our
 * handle_exception() function.
 *
 * We work around this constraint by allocating these data structures in a fixed
 * memory region at WIN64_SEH_DATA_ADDR and map an UNWIND_INFO to this region
 * using RtlAddFunctionTable(). Foreign calls (see EMIT-C-CALL) place the target
 * address in RBX and call a thunk within this region. The thunk swaps out the
 * return address with the thunk's return address thereby establishing a
 * frame-based exception handler. The original address (pointing into Lisp code)
 * is stored in a non-volatile, callee-saved register, allowing the thunk to
 * jump back to Lisp. The exception handler is a trampoline to
 * handle_exception().
 *
 * In the future, should we segregate code objects into dedicated code areas
 * smaller than 4 GB, these thunks could be removed, and UNWIND_INFO could be
 * associated directly with such areas.

 * (AK writes:)
 *
 * It may be unobvious, but (probably) the most straightforward way of
 * providing some sane CL:LISTEN semantics for line-mode console
 * channel requires _dedicated input thread_.
 *
 * LISTEN should return true iff the next (READ-CHAR) won't have to
 * wait. As our console may be shared with another process, entirely
 * out of our control, looking at the events in PeekConsoleEvent
 * result (and searching for #\Return) doesn't cut it.
 *
 * We decided that console input thread must do something smarter than
 * a bare loop of continuous ReadConsoleW(). On Unix, user experience
 * with the terminal is entirely unaffected by the fact that some
 * process does (or doesn't) call read(); the situation on MS Windows
 * is different.
 *
 * Echo output and line editing present on MS Windows while some
 * process is waiting in ReadConsole(); otherwise all input events are
 * buffered. If our thread were calling ReadConsole() all the time, it
 * would feel like Unix cooked mode.
 *
 * But we don't write a Unix emulator here, even if it sometimes feels
 * like that; therefore preserving this aspect of console I/O seems a
 * good thing to us.
 *
 * LISTEN itself becomes trivial with dedicated input thread, but the
 * goal stated above -- provide `native' user experience with blocked
 * console -- don't play well with this trivial implementation.
 *
 * What's currently implemented is a compromise, looking as something
 * in between Unix cooked mode and Win32 line mode.
 *
 * 1. As long as no console I/O function is called (incl. CL:LISTEN),
 * console looks `blocked': no echo, no line editing.
 *
 * 2. (READ-CHAR), (READ-SEQUENCE) and other functions doing real
 * input result in the ReadConsole request (in a dedicated thread);
 *
 * 3. Once ReadConsole is called, it is not cancelled in the
 * middle. In line mode, it returns when <Enter> key is hit (or
 * something like that happens). Therefore, if line editing and echo
 * output had a chance to happen, console won't look `blocked' until
 * the line is entered (even if line input was triggered by
 * (READ-CHAR)).
 *
 * 4. LISTEN may request ReadConsole too (if no other thread is
 * reading the console and no data are queued). It's the only case
 * when the console becomes `unblocked' without any actual input
 * requested by Lisp code.  LISTEN check if there is at least one
 * input event in PeekConsole queue; unless there is such an event,
 * ReadConsole is not triggered by LISTEN.
 *
 * 5. Console-reading Lisp thread now may be interrupted immediately;
 * ReadConsole call itself, however, continues until the line is
 * entered.
