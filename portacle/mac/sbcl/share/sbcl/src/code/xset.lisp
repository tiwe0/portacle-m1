;;;; XSET
;;;;
;;;; A somewhat efficient set implementation that can store arbitrary
;;;; objects. For small sets the data is stored in a list, but when
;;;; the amount of elements grows beyond +XSET-LIST-SIZE-LIMIT+, we
;;;; switch to a hash-table instead.
;;;;
;;;; ALLOC-XSET allocates an empty XSET. ADD-TO-XSET adds an element
;;;; to an XSET: it should be used only on freshly allocated XSETs.
;;;;
;;;; XSET-EMPTY-P, XSET-INTERSECTION, XSET-SUBSET-P, and XSET-MEMBER-P
;;;; do the obvious things. MAP-XSET maps over the element, but
;;;; requires a function as the first argument -- not a function
;;;; designator.
;;;;
;;;; Note: XSET always uses EQL as the equivalence test
