;;;; the SYMBOL-TABLE structure

;;; Packages are implemented using a special kind of hashtable -
;;; the storage is a single vector in which each cell is both key and value.
;;; While previously we also used a parallel vector of 8-bit hash codes,
;;; that turned out to be a pessimization on modern systems, where memory
;;; can be be read faster than it was 27 years ago. (That's when it was
;;; discovered - so it is claimed - that without a comparison for hash,
;;; the majority of time loading fasls was due to paging in symbol names)
;;;
;;; But hardware-based prefetch makes it so that it costs no more to compare
;;; a symbol's hash code than to first compare a smaller hash that doesn't
;;; require dereferencing the symbol, only to use it as the guard condition
;;; to compare the full symbol-hash, and only then the symbol-name.
;;;
;;; In fairness to the former implementation, for technical reasons
;;; it was not possible to use SYMBOL-HASH as the hash value by which
;;; to avoid spurious STRING= calls that would definitely fail.
;;; Prior to change 06ccf13ed3, there were two reasons for that:
;;;   (1) we didn't force interned symbols to have a precomputed hash
;;;   (2) NIL has a strange hash. That was resolved by making any random
;;;       symbol whose name is spelled "NIL" have the identical strange hash
;;;       so that the hash is a pure function of the name's characters.

;; Give 48 bits to SYMBOL-NAME, which spans 256 TiB of memory.
;; Omitting the lowtag bits could span up to 4 PiB because we could left-shift
;; and re-tag to read the name.  That seems excessive though. Another viable
;; technique would be to store a heap-base-relative pointer, which might be
;; needed if dynamic-space is small but at a very high address.
;; For now, it seems fine to treat the low 48 bits as a tagged pointer.
