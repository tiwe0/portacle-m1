;;;; converting symbols from SB-XC::FOO to COMMON-LISP::FOO when

;;;; of fundamental COMMON-LISP things like PROCLAIM and CLASS and
;;;; ARRAY-RANK-LIMIT, so that we don't trash the cross-compilation
;;;; host when defining the cross-compiler, but the distinctions go

;;; When cross-compiling, EVAL-WHEN :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL code is executed
;;; in the host Common Lisp, not the target. A certain amount of
;;; dancing around is required in order for this to work more or less
;;; correctly. (Fortunately, more or less correctly is good enough --
;;; it only needs to work on the EVAL-WHEN expressions found in the
;;; SBCL sources themselves, and we can exercise self-control to keep
;;; them from including anything which too strongly resembles a
;;; language lawyer's test case.)
;;;
;;; In order to make the dancing happen, we need to make a distinction
;;; between SB-XC and COMMON-LISP when we're executing a form at
;;; compile time (i.e. within EVAL-WHEN :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL) but we need
;;; to treat SB-XC as synonymous with COMMON-LISP otherwise.
