;;;; This file contains portable versions of low-level functions and macros
;;;; which are ripe for implementation specific customization. None of the code
;;;; in this file *has* to be customized for a particular Common Lisp
;;;; implementation. Moreover, in some implementations it may not make any
;;;; sense to customize some of this code.
;;;;
;;;; The original version was intended to support portable customization to
;;;; lotso different Lisp implementations. This functionality is gone in the
;;;; current version, and it now runs only under SBCL. (Now that ANSI Common
;;;; Lisp has mixed CLOS into the insides of the system (e.g. error handling
;;;; and printing) so deeply that it's not very meaningful to bootstrap Common
;;;; Lisp without CLOS, the old functionality is of dubious use. -- WHN
;;;; 19981108)
