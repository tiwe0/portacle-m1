;;;; TAIL-CALL-VARIABLE

;;; For tail-call-variable, we have to copy the arguments from the end
;;; of our stack frame (where args are produced) to the start of our
;;; stack frame (where args are expected).
;;;
;;; We take the function to call in RAX and a pointer to the arguments in
;;; RSI. EBP stays the same over the jump, and the old frame pointer is
;;; still saved in the first stack slot. The return-pc is saved in
;;; the second stack slot, so we have to push it to make it look like
;;; we actually called. We also have to compute RCX from the difference
;;; between RSI and the stack top.
