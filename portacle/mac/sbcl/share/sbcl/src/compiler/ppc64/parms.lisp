;;; FIXME I: Beware, all ye who trespass here. Despite its name,
;;; FLOAT-STICKY-BITS is not the byte specifier for sticky bits in the
;;; floating point control word. It is more like "accrued exceptions"
;;; where FLOAT-EXCEPTIONS-BYTE is "current exceptions". Consequently,
;;; on architectures where there is no "current exceptions"
;;; FLOAT-EXCEPTIONS-BYTE and FLOAT-STICKY-BITS had better be the
;;; same.

;;; FIXME II: So, I've now documented this in comments in the PowerPC
;;; tree. This may not make it easy to find for when new architectures
;;; get backends written...
