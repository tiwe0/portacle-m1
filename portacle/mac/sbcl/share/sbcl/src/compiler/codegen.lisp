;;; Some platforms support unboxed constants immediately following the boxed

;;; * CANONICALIZE-INLINE-CONSTANT: converts a constant descriptor (list) into
;;;    a canonical description, to be used as a key in an EQUAL hash table
;;;    and to guide the generation of the constant itself.
;;; * INLINE-CONSTANT-VALUE: given a canonical constant descriptor, computes
;;;    two values:
;;;     1. A label that will be used to emit the constant (usually a
;;;         sb-assem:label)
;;;     2. A value that will be returned to code generators referring to
;;;         the constant (on x86oids, an EA object)
;;; * SORT-INLINE-CONSTANTS: Receives a vector of unique constants;
;;;    the car of each entry is the constant descriptor, and the cdr the
;;;    corresponding label. Destructively returns a vector of constants
;;;    sorted in emission order. It could actually perform arbitrary
;;;    modifications to the vector, e.g. to fuse constants of different
;;;    size.
;;; * EMIT-INLINE-CONSTANT: receives a constant descriptor and its associated
;;;    label. Emits the constant.
;;;
;;; Implementing this feature lets VOP generators use sb-c:register-inline-constant
;;; to get handles (as returned by sb-vm:inline-constant-value) from constant
;;; descriptors.
